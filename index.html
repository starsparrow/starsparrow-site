    <h1 id="title"># welcome to my humble home</h1>
    <p>I am an amateur Python programmer and <a href="./assets/img/dilbert-linux-beard.png" alt="A snobby UNIX user tells a Windows user to get a better co    mputer" title="me_irl in 30 years">Linux beard wannabe</a> living in the United States with my wife and two dogs.</p>
    <p>Apart from coding, my hobbies/interests include cooking, photography, aviation, meteorology, and playing guitar.</p>
    <p>This site's purpose is to publicize information about some of my projects (a couple of them are actually deployed here, too):</p>
        <div class="project">
            <p class="projectname">Foood?!?</p>
            <p class="projectdesc">A simple "dinner spinner" application that displays a random meal (or list of meals). Used to answer the age-old questio    n, "What do you want to eat?" It is written in Python, using the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> web application microframework.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <p class="projectname">kala - ephemeral message board</p>
            <p class="projectdesc">A public message board that only stores twenty messages at a time. New messages will bump older ones off. Nothing is sto    red in a database--once a message is gone, it's gone (until somebody posts it again). Not necessarily very useful, just another little exercise in <a href=    "http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask.</a></p>
